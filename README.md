----

You can download this directory without Git or GitHub by clicking this link:

https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/USGS-R/exampleRproj

To open as an RStudio project:

1. Extract the contents of the zipfile (Windows - right click, then choose `Extract all`). Accept defaults.
1. Rename the directory (at least drop the `-master`). 
1. [Is there a better way?!] GitHub downloads the whole directory inside of a zipfile. Go inside the first level, and then move that folder to the location you want it to exist (not downloads).
1. Go to RStudio and click `File`, then `New Project...`.
1. Select `Existing Directory`.
1. Click `Browse` and find your downloaded and unzipped folder.
1. Finally, click `Create Project`.
